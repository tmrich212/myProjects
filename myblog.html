                            So full disclaimer,  I don't really know what I'm doing I'm just rolling with it as it comes. But I will start by telling you hey, welcome to my personal website and thank you for taking the time to know me. 
                            I am currently 24 years old and the first time I was introduced to coding was my intro to digital studies class, where we used Codecademy and at the end of the course built our own websites. 
                            Mine was trash. However, I felt bad that I had just discovered how intriguing working with code was to me. I had pondered the idea years before if I were to try out some computer science classes 
                            but my bestfriend and others mostly deterred me. Caving into the peer pressure I went ahead with their advice not to pursue it. Before graduation I was at dinner with my friend Josh, who majored in Computer 
                            Science and Mathematics. He informed me that Philosophy majors are actually well inclined to excel in CompSci. My mind was blow. Fast forward to August 2018 and I started my journey through HTML, CSS, 
                            and finally to Javascript in 2019. I haven't mentioned my name yet. Hi I'm Taylor, a self-taught developer.
